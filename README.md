# ReneWind
Analyzed collected data of generator failure of wind turbines to reduce the number of failures and overall maintenance costs.
* Identified XGBoost model with undersampled data as the optimal model with a recall score of 0.892.
* Reduced maintenance costs 30% (6.6 million USD) by fully implementing the model.
* Advised exploring new technologies to better predict gearbox failures.

*Key skills: EDA, Data Preprocessing, Bagging Classifiers (Bagging and Random Forest), Boosting Classifier (AdaBoost,Gradient Boosting,XGBoost), Stacking Classifier, Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization, Business insights*
